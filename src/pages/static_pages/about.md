Who We Are

St Georges Pop-In is the place to come for people with learning difficulties who are looking to socialise. Come along to meet new friends in a supportive environment with activities like art, music and dance (and always a game of bingo). Alongside this more therapeutic endeavours to explore our feelings though wellbeing, dance-movement and music workshops and exercise classes as well as a place where practical skills can be improved 



What We Do

We provide a variety of activities for our members throughout the year and have a regular dedicate art group and a Saturday club.

Our main objective is to support our members in developing confidence in themselves and establish and develop links to the wider community. Members are actively involved in helping run and develop the program of activities at the Pop-In. The Members Committee allows the members to have their say and the staff then help develop these decisions into reality
